# WasteNotWantNotify

This is the basic setup of an application that can track food waste. I used a Bootstrap template ([SB Admin 2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwicy7Gg5sCAAxV57DgGHVzNClQQFnoECB0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstartbootstrap.com%2Ftheme%2Fsb-admin-2&usg=AOvVaw3GB6SsuLC2h8V6n2rWK4lW&opi=89978449)) and converted it to React.

To get the waste tracking functionality, I connected Firebase and made a new Collection for waste tracking. Currently it's a very rudimentary tracker with just two parameters, name of item, and its quantity. I plan to add more in the future.

On the Dashboard, at present I have just added the Food Waste Tracker without removing or editing the template further as this is still a working project.
